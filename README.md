IMPORTANT NOTE: 

Our system uses marginally more Zookeeper connections, as such, 
all tests need to be run with the following flag set in the Zookeeper
configuration file.

maxClientCnxns=0

--- 

Job Tracker: 
start_jobtracker.sh <zookeeper host> <zookeeper port>

Worker:
start_worker.sh <zookeeper host> <zookeeper port>

FileServer:
start_fileserver.sh <zookeeper host> <zookeeper port>

Client 
submit_job.sh <zookeeper host> <zookeeper port> <password hash>
â€” this allows a user to submit a job request. It prints the job id to the console, the student can defined their own student ID

The order in which services begin do not matter, each waits for the services they communicate with or depend on before beginning.
